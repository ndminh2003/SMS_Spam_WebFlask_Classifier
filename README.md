# SMS Spam Classifier

This is my attempt at a sms spam classidier website. You just need to enter a text into the
website and it will show whether it is spam or ham. The dataset was created from 2 dataset from kaggle. 
#### Notice: Over 86% of the dataset is ham so there will be overfitting. If you want you can just use the dataset from kaggle. It will reduce overfitting quiet a lot.
